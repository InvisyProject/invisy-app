## **🧐 Problem Statement**
**1. Inefficiency in Invoice Management**
Managing invoices is a time-consuming and error-prone process for businesses, often requiring multiple steps and involving various intermediaries. This inefficiency can lead to delayed payments, lost invoices, and increased administrative costs.

**2. Cash Flow Challenges**
Businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), frequently face cash flow issues due to delayed payments. Traditional invoice factoring and financing solutions are often costly and involve lengthy approval processes.

**3. Lack of Transparency and Security**
Traditional invoicing systems lack transparency, making it difficult for businesses to track the status of invoices and payments. Additionally, these systems are vulnerable to fraud and data breaches.

**4. Limited Access to Financing**
Small businesses often struggle to access financing due to stringent requirements and lack of collateral. Traditional financial intermediaries impose high fees and interest rates, making financing expensive and less accessible.

## **💡 Idea / Solution**

### **Invisy: A Decentralized Invoice Management Platform**

Invisy leverages the power of blockchain technology and the Request Network to provide a comprehensive solution for invoice management. By tokenizing invoices as NFTs, Invisy facilitates a transparent, secure, and efficient ecosystem for creating, canceling, approving, paying, managing, lending, and borrowing invoices.

### **How Invisy Works**
- Tokenization of Invoices: Invoices are converted into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and traceability.

- Decentralized Marketplace: Businesses can list their invoice NFTs on a decentralized marketplace, where investors can purchase them, providing immediate liquidity.

- Smart Contracts: Automated smart contracts using Request Network handle the creation, transfer, and settlement of invoices, reducing the need for intermediaries and minimizing human error.


## **Features**

- **Create and Tokenize Invoices:** Easily create invoices and tokenize them as NFTs on the blockchain.
- **Cancel and Approve Invoices:** Secure mechanisms for canceling and approving invoices, ensuring accurate record-keeping.
- **Payment Tracking:** Real-time tracking of invoice payments for transparency and accountability.
- **Marketplace Listing:** List invoice NFTs on the Invisy marketplace for a global network of investors.
- **Invoice Factoring:** Sell invoices to investors at a discount to receive immediate cash flow.
- **Immutable Records:** Blockchain ensures that all invoice data is secure, immutable, and transparent.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Automated processes for invoice creation, transfer, and payment settlement.
- **Immediate Liquidity:** Quickly access funds by selling invoices, enhancing cash flow management.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Manage invoices, track payments, and monitor investments with ease.
- **Web3 Integration:** Seamless integration with blockchain wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for easy access.

## Configuration

In your next.config.js file, ensure you have the following configuration:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: false,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

#### Explanation

This configuration ensures that the Svelte web components render correctly. The swcMinify: false setting is crucial because Svelte web components and their rendering nature can sometimes conflict with aggressive minification processes. Disabling SWC minification helps prevent potential issues with web component rendering.
